Day 36 : Loops & Functions — 2.0 Job Ready AI Powered Cohort (Sheryians)

- Practice Question/Concepts OR Functions in JavaScript
 - do..while Loop --> The do...while loop executes the code block at least once before checking the Conditions.
   it is used when you want the loop to run once even if the condition is false
    
    - key Points: 
         - the condition is checked after the loop body executes, so the loop will always run at least once.
         - syntax:
            do {
               // code block to be executed
            } while (condition);
 - Recursion in Js --> Recursion mean's a Functions calling itself.
    - key Points:
         - A recursive function must have a base case , otherwise it will run indefinitely.
         - syntax:
            function recursiveFunction(parameters) {
               // base case
               if (condition) {
                  return value;
               }
               // recursive case
               return recursiveFunction(modifiedParameters);
            }
 - Functions arguments and parameters --> Parameters are the variables listed in a function definition.
                                          Arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it is called.
    - key Points:
         - Parameters act as placeholders inside the function and the arguments are the real values supplied during function calls.
          - syntax:
              function functionName(parameter1, parameter2) {
                // function body
              }
              functionName(argument1, argument2);
 - variables Hoisting in Js --> In JavaScript, variable hoisting is a behavior where variable declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.
    - key Points:
         - Only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.
         - Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their function scope, while let and const are hoisted to the top of their block scope but are not initialized.
          - syntax:
              console.log(x); // undefined
              var x = 5;

              console.log(y); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
              let y = 10;          
 - Functions Hoisting in Js --> Function hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.
    - key Points:
         - Function declarations are fully hoisted, meaning you can call them before they are defined in the code.
         - Function expressions (including arrow functions) are not hoisted in the same way; they behave like variable assignments.
          - syntax:
              console.log(myFunction()); // "Hello, World!"
              function myFunction() {
                return "Hello, World!";
              }

              console.log(myExpression()); // TypeError: myExpression is not a function
              var myExpression = function() {
                return "Hello, World!";
              };                          
 - Arguments Object in Js --> The arguments object is an array-like object accessible inside functions that contains the values of the arguments passed to that function.
    - key Points:
         - It is not a real array, but it has a length property and can be accessed using indices.
         - It allows functions to handle an arbitrary number of arguments.
          - syntax:
              function myFunction() {
                for (let i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
                  console.log(arguments[i]);
                }
              }
              myFunction(1, 2, 3); // logs 1, 2, 3
